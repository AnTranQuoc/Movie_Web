**<h1 style="text-align: center">Movie websiteüìΩÔ∏è built on React‚öõÔ∏è</h1>**
The website I used to obtain the necessary information was the *[OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)*. You will need to enter your email to obtain the API_KEY in order to access MoviesParadise.

``` typescript
const MOVIE_URL: string = `https://www.omdbapi.com/?&apikey=[SUA_APIKEY]`;
```
The site has a movie search tab and a search button. Not to mention a loading screen that I built using the *[react-spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners)* library. There is also, on each of the cards, a watch button and a download button, these are for demonstration purposes, that is, they do not have any action.
